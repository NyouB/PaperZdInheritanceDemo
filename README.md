# PaperZdInheritanceDemo
Test of Animation blueprint inheritance in paperzd

To be closer of what I'm trying to do I had to based the demo on the Lyra project.
But to make it easier to browse, all the code specific to the demo is localized in the gamefeature plugin "PaperZDBlueprintSharedDemo". Which is in fact the folder "PaperZdBPInheritanceDemo\Plugins\GameFeatures\test" . Sorry about that, I tried the feature and when it was working I couldn't rename the folder properly without breaking everything.
The C++ classes are also in the gamefeature.
